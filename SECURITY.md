## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, please report it privately:

1. **Email**: contact@leon-stadler.com
2. **Subject**: Security Vulnerability Report - Sportify

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

I will respond as soon as possible and work with you to address the issue before making it public.

## Security Best Practices

When using this software:

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA when available
- Only accept friend requests from people you actually know
- Keep your account credentials secure
- Report any security concerns immediately

## Disclosure Policy

As this is a personal fun project, I cannot guarantee fixed response times. However, I will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible
- Review and assess the vulnerability as time permits
- Keep you informed of progress when significant updates are available
- Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- Credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

Thank you for helping keep Sportify secure!
